      <h1>Hesitantly, you knock on the door...</h1>
      <p>The door creeps open and ah!! On the other side is a ghost! You start to turn to run, but you hear a sniffle and see that the ghost is that of a little girl. She asks you if you’d like to play for a while and you say ‘yes’. After an hour or so, the ghost thanks you for keeping her company and points to the path behind the house. “That’s the way out…” She says as she starts to fade away, “Come play with me again.”</p>
