      <h1>You go into the cave...</h1>
      <p>You go into the cave and reach out towards the figure. “Hello?” You say and then gasp. You come face to face with a person with dark red eyes, grinning at you with giant white fangs. It’s a vampire! Before you can run, the creature tackles you and bites into your neck. You feel everything go cold as you stare up at the cave ceiling.</p>
